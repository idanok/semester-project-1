            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <div class="p-img-horizontal">
                <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort
                to keep the displays in good order and ready for
                visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its
                perks including getting to see behind the scenes
                of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures,
                and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers
                come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits
                and strategies for the museum. You can help volunteer
                in a number of different spheres. Please contact us
                if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
                involved.</p>
